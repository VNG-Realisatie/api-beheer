# Contributing

We – [VNG realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/) and the maintainers of this project – acknowledge we can only reach a high quality of managing the API standards together with you. Thus we appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in Issues

You don't need to change any of our documentation to be a contributor. Please help us by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions. To do this, you can [create a GitHub Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the [GitHub Issues for VNG-Realisatie/api-beheer](https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/api-beheer/issues).

## Documentation in Pull Requests

If you want to add to the documentation you should make a Pull Request. If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### 1. Make your changes

This project uses the **OneFlow branching model** and workflow. When you've forked this repository, please make sure to create a feature branch following the OneFlow model. Read this [short blogpost](http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) when you're not yet familiar with OneFlow.

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message). Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

### 2. Pull Request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to address and the issue numbers that this Pull Request fixes/addresses.

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer. However, usually, a new Pull Request needs some improvements before it can be merged. Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback. If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation.

If your documentation has passed human review, it is merged.

### 4. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation have become an integral part of this project. You are the hero we need.
